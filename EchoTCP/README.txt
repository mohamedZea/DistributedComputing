## Contents

You should have received an archive containing this file (README) and
a directory called "examples" containing five Java files:
            EchoService.java
            MultithreadedTCPServer.java
            TCPClient.java
            TCPServer.java
            UserInterface.java


## Compiling

You should be able to compile all five classes as usual:

    > cd examples
    > javac *.java


(You should compile all the files at once, as shown above).

You can (of course) import the files into a project in your IDE, but please
remember that you will need to be able to run the programs OUTSIDE the IDE.

## Operation

Do not run the classes from inside the example directory, but from the parent
directory.  Start the server first (the client will crash if the server is not
running).

    > cd ..
    > java example/TCPServer

The server will give no output until a client request is received.

In a seperate window, run the client

   >java examples/TCPClient
   Enter message for the Server, or end the session with . : this is a test
   Server answers: THIS IS A TEST
   Enter message for the Server, or end the session with . : Foo FBar
   Server answers: FOO BAR
   Enter message for the Server, or end the session with . : Enough.
   Server answers: ENOUGH.
   Enter message for the Server, or end the session with . : .
   >

Go back to the window with the server.  In the meantime, the server should have
given output like this:
   Received: this is a test
   Received: Foo Bar
   Received: Enough.
   Received: .
   Session ended, Server remains active

You should probably kill the server now.
(Use Ctrl-C in Linux or MacOS or whatever key works in your OS. ;-)

Now try the server with TWO clients - you should note that the first client
blocks the server for the duration of a session.  The multithreaded client
shows how a non-blocking (threaded) server works.
